## Development Notes

I used `node` version `20.12.0`

```
nvm install 20.12.0
```

```
nvm use 20.12.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with

```
npm run dev
```

Make sure that node, typescipt and it's supporting dev modules were already installed properly on system.
